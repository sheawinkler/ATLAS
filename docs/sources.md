# Sources & Research

Papers and research that inform the ATLAS architecture. Organized by **status relative to the current release (V3.0.1)** so readers can tell at a glance which papers underpin what's actually shipping, what's held over from earlier versions, and what's on the roadmap.

Three status buckets:

1. **Active in V3.0.1** — the paper directly underpins a component that ships in V3.0.1. If you're implementing or extending that component, read these first.
2. **Deprecated / superseded** — the paper informed a V1/V2/V3.0 component that is no longer part of the V3.0.1 pipeline. Kept here for historical context and because older branches still reference them.
3. **Roadmap / exploratory** — the paper informs planned but unshipped work (V3.1 in progress, V3.2 exploratory, or later).

Within each bucket, entries are grouped by the ATLAS subsystem they relate to.

## 1. Active in V3.0.1

Research that informs components shipping in the current release.

### Test-Time Compute (foundational)

The premise behind ATLAS: scaling inference compute on a frozen model can match or exceed a bigger one.

- **Brown et al., 2024.** *Large Language Monkeys: Scaling Inference Compute with Repeated Sampling.* arXiv [2407.21787](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21787). Weaker models exceed stronger ones with enough samples — the core motivation for every ATLAS version including V3.0.1.

### V3 Pipeline — Phase 3 (Verified Iterative Refinement, shipped)

- **Chen et al., 2022.** *CodeT: Code Generation with Generated Tests.* [ICLR 2023](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ktrw68Cmu9c). Blueprint for self-generated test harnesses in V3.0.1's PR-CoT repair.

### Geometric Lens (core, shipped)

V3.0.1 ships C(x) (MLP cost field) and G(x) (XGBoost quality prediction).

- **Blondel et al. (Google DeepMind), 2025.** *Autoregressive Models are Secretly Energy-Based Models.* arXiv [2512.15605](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15605). Exact ARM↔EBM bijection. **Primary theoretical justification for the Lens existing at all** — the Lens is the EBM correction layer the paper describes.
- **Anthropic, 2026.** *When Models Manipulate Manifolds.* Internal research communication. Foundational intuition that motivated energy-based scoring.
- **Crespo, J., 2026.** *Everyone's Wrong About AI Programming — Except Maybe Anthropic.* Medium. Accessible framing of the geometric perspective that ATLAS operationalizes.
- **Aghajanyan et al., 2020.** *Intrinsic Dimensionality Explains the Effectiveness of Language Model Fine-Tuning.* arXiv [2012.13255](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13255). Theoretical backbone for training small auxiliary networks (Lens MLPs / XGBoost classifiers) instead of the base model.

### Pattern Cache & Memory (shipped)

The V3.0.1 Confidence Router uses a pattern cache with tiered decay (CACHE_HIT / FAST_PATH / STANDARD / HARD_PATH), co-occurrence graph, and STM→LTM promotion.

- **Ebbinghaus, 1885.** *Über das Gedächtnis* (On Memory). The forgetting curve — memory strength decays roughly exponentially with time. Underlies the tiered decay schedule.
- **ACT-R** (Anderson et al.). Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational. ~30-day half-life for activation — numeric baseline for cache decay.
- **Luhmann, N.** *Zettelkasten System.* Knowledge management via displacement and organic pruning — conceptual model for cache eviction.
- **Behrouz et al. (Google Research), 2025.** *Titans: Learning to Memorize at Test Time.* arXiv [2501.00663](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00663). Surprise-based memory. **Implemented in V3.0.1** via category-surprise momentum in `geometric-lens/cache/consolidator.py`.
- **Park et al., 2025.** *Memoria: Human-Inspired Memory Architecture.* arXiv [2310.03052](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03052). Hebbian learning + lifespan-based memory. **Implemented in V3.0.1** via the `Count(i,j) / Count(i,i)` edge-weight formulation in `geometric-lens/cache/co_occurrence.py` and the STM→LTM promotion criteria in `consolidator.py`.

### Lens Evolution — continual learning (shipped)

Phase 4 of the V3 PRD. V3.0.1 retrains C(x) across domains without wiping prior knowledge using EWC + replay buffer. Code lives in `geometric-lens/geometric_lens/{ewc,replay_buffer,training}.py`; validation in `tests/v3/test_phase4_validation.py`.

- **Kirkpatrick et al., 2017.** *Overcoming Catastrophic Forgetting in Neural Networks (EWC).* PNAS, [doi:10.1073/pnas.1611835114](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1611835114). **Primary citation for V3.0.1 EWC** — diagonal Fisher penalty added during C(x) retraining to protect prior-domain weights.
- **Lin, 1992 / Parisi et al., 2019.** Experience Replay / continual learning surveys. Basis for the domain-stratified replay buffer that samples representative pass/fail pairs from every domain C(x) has trained on.

### Design constraints (shipped)

Papers that informed architectural decisions in V3.0.1 by describing what *not* to do.

- **Shumailov et al., 2024.** *The Curse of Recursion: Training on Generated Data Makes Models Forget (Model Collapse).* arXiv [2305.17493](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17493). Model collapse from synthetic data — the risk that gated every "train on our own traces" proposal. **This is a major reason V3.0.1 freezes the base model and trains only the Lens.**

---

## 2. Deprecated / superseded

Research that informed V1, V2, or V3.0 components that are *not* part of V3.0.1. Kept for historical context.

- **Leviathan et al., 2023.** *Fast Inference from Transformers via Speculative Decoding.* ICML 2023, arXiv [2211.17192](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17192). 2-3× speedup via draft models. **Used in V3.0's 14B spec-decode configuration; V3.0.1 runs 9B without a draft model** (hybrid DeltaNet architecture, `--parallel 4` single-slot decoding). Preserved in `entrypoint-v3-specdec.sh` for reference.
- **Hu et al., 2021.** *LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models.* arXiv [2106.09685](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685). **Conceptual reference only.** ATLAS does not apply LoRA to the base model — weights stay frozen. Retained here because it seeded the PEFT mindset behind the small-auxiliary-network pattern used by the Lens.
- **Dettmers et al., 2023.** *QLoRA: Efficient Finetuning of Quantized LLMs.* arXiv [2305.14314](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314). **Conceptual reference only.** Same status as LoRA — no QLoRA adapters on the V3.0.1 base model.
- **Zhang et al., 2024.** *RAFT: Adapting Language Model to Domain Specific RAG.* arXiv [2403.10131](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10131). Considered during RAG design but **not directly implemented** in V3.0.1 — the router handles distractor tolerance empirically rather than through RAFT-style training.
- **Asai et al., 2023.** *Self-RAG: Retrieve-Generate-Critique with self-reflection.* arXiv [2310.11511](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11511). **Not directly implemented in V3.0.1.** The proxy makes retrieval decisions via the Confidence Router, not Self-RAG critique tokens.

## 3. Roadmap / exploratory

Research that informs planned work. None of these are part of V3.0.1; they are here to give collaborators a reading list for the tracking issues.

### V3.1 (in progress)

- **Sotnikov, D., 2026.** *chiasmus: tree-sitter + solver call graph for code analysis.* GitHub [yogthos/chiasmus](https://github.com/yogthos/chiasmus). Inspiration for V3.1 structural code reasoning — tracked as [issue #39](https://github.com/itigges22/ATLAS/issues/39).

### V3.2 (exploratory)

- **Karan & Chatterji, 2025.** *Reasoning with Sampling: Your Base Model is Smarter Than You Think.* arXiv [2510.14901](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14901). MCMC over logits during decoding — tracked as [issue #40](https://github.com/itigges22/ATLAS/issues/40).

---

## What this list intentionally excludes

- **MoE / expert quantization work** (DynaExq, MoPEQ, MxMoE) — relevant only to the V3 Phase 5/6 model-swap roadmap, which is not active development.
- **Medusa** (parallel decoding heads) — ATLAS uses standard draft-model speculative decoding (in V3.0), not Medusa.
- **Forward-Forward, Direct Feedback Alignment** — speculative alternative learning rules, not in current plans.
- **Community posts without a primary source** — referenced informally in PRs/issues but not cited here.

If a paper you expected to see is missing and it's actually load-bearing for something shipping, open an issue and we'll add it.
